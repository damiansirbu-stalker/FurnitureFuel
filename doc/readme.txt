Thank you for the support, I do not need donations. Reviews, ratings, and proper bug reports help.
An organized group plagiarizes my work, posts daily lies and mass-downvotes my mods everywhere.
Most modpacks use my work, established projects integrate with it, and downloads near 1 million.

Removes fuel and battery consumption from all placeable light furniture.
Lights no longer require batteries, kerosene, or gauss ammo to operate.

One line in the light-furniture binder forces infinite fuel on.
All visual effects, sounds, flickering, and toggle behavior are preserved.

Features:

Affected items:
  Metal Torch (was: batteries_dead, 800h)
  Gas Lamp (was: kerosene, 1200h)
  Gas Lamp GAMMA variant (was: kerosene, 99999h)
  Light Altar (was: ammo_gauss, 2400h)

All other furniture (workshop, radio, displays, stashes) does not consume fuel and is unaffected.

Requirements:
Anomaly 1.5.3
Modded exes: themrdemonized 20250908 or newer, or AOEngine v0.55 or newer. The full feature set needs the latest demonized build. A feature that needs a newer one stays inactive on older exes.
xlibs (https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/xlibs-1001)
Hideout Furniture by Aoldri (provides the furniture base)

Install: load after Hideout Furniture and any Hideout Furniture patches.

Compatibility:
Depends on xlibs and Hideout Furniture (Aoldri), loaded after it. Install and uninstall mid-save work. Tested: Anomaly 1.5.3, GAMMA.
Disable (conflict, superseded, problematic):
- Any other mod that overrides the light-furniture binder - this is a full-file replacement, so two of them collide and only the load-order winner runs.
It coexists with everything else.

How It's Built:

The code and patterns are original, built on best practices from the best STALKER modders and hands-on reverse-engineering of X-Ray.
The design stays engine-native and minimal, with event-native pub/sub over polling, work spread across frames through deferred queues and rate limiters, and per-level caches that replace world scans.
The raycasting and range math are hand-written and load-tested live, following the engine's own standards and flags.
Where scripting hits an engine limit, the fix is made in X-Ray itself, in the modded exes.
Performance is the first invariant, so every flow stays under 2ms or the build rewrites or drops it, profiled continuously with JitProfiler and hand-tested on unoptimized, single-threaded exes.
Every mod carries OpenTelemetry-style tracing and performance monitoring, spanning world events and every flow, gated by the log level so it costs nothing when off.
Every commit runs the full pipeline locally and in CI, with luacheck, a custom STALKER selene build, and a load test on engine stubs.
Rule layers then check Lua practice, engine truth, conventions, contracts, release, security, and docs.
Every rate, threshold, and toggle is exposed through MCM or LTX with nothing left hard-coded, and it writes no engine values, keeping its state within engine bounds so a save can never corrupt.
It runs on one xlibs rulebook shared across the whole mod family, the same protection, distances, faction logic, and combat reads in every mod.
It depends on no other mod, not even the author's own, and needs only X-Ray and xlibs beneath it.
See the Health and JitProfiler links up top for every test and smoke result, and the mod's real CPU and allocation cost.

Credits:
Aoldri made the original Hideout Furniture mod.
Altogolik provided support, ideas, and source materials.

Usage and License:
  Modpacks: allowed and encouraged. Keep the readme and license files.
  Addons, patches, integrations: allowed. Credit "FurnitureFuel by Damian Sirbu" visibly on your mod page.
  Reproducing the implementation in other software: not allowed, even with credit.
  The full license is in the LICENSE file and on GitHub.

Diagnostics and reporting:
Every release goes through careful engineering and testing, but bugs can still slip through.
To report one, reproduce with debug logging on, and the world log where the mod has one.
First rule this mod out: reproduce with it off, then on. The cleanest test is this mod alone on vanilla and xlibs.
Send the traces on the Anomaly Discord, or file a defect on GitHub with the same information.
Attach xray.log, the mod log, the engine build, the modlist, and the load order.
For deep technical details and mechanisms, check the architecture docs on GitHub.
